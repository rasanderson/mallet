The Cabo Verdean economy remains vulnerable to climate change and drought, remaining also the structural characteristics of subsistence farming, and this should be an important milestone of economic and environmental sustainability and in order to build its resilience it must take the front line of priorities. The annual rate of change in real GDP per person employed increased in 2017, after two years of decline, with the unemployment rate reaching 12.2% in 2017. Agriculture is the sector of activity that creates the most employment, followed by trade, except in periods of drought as was the case in 2017."	0.01	0.04	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.02	0.00	0.52	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.01	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Geographic dispersion is another vulnerability because the country is an archipelago of 10 islands, with a very steep and rugged terrain (in most islands) has extremely heavy effects on the costs of basic infrastructure, ser- vices and essential goods. The strategic location, the extension of the coastline and the exclusive economic zone make Cabo Verde particularly vulnerable to new threats, such as drug and human trafficking, illegal immigration and inter- national crime, and this constitutes its vulnerability to security. In the energy field, energy dependence is estimated at about 75% compared to the outside world."	0.11	0.00	0.01	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.02	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.20	0.00	0.12	0.01

The food insecu- rity in Cabo Verde has a structural and multi-factorial nature and concerns the structural deficit of the national food production and the strong dependence on the international market, and the economic accessibility weaknesses. Strengthening the Food Security and Nutrition Information System (FSNIS) is a first-rate challenge. The National Strategy for Food Security for the 2020 horizon places greater emphasis on nutritional issues and the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRA) and its implementation in the context of good articulation and coordination between the various actors involved in food and nutrition security, will contribute to the achievement of SDGs 2. The Law on the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRA), the National School Feeding Program, the National Program for Agricultural Investment, Food and Nutrition Security for the period 2018-2022, the Single Social Registry, National Resilience Pri- orities (NRP / AGIR) of Cabo Verde and the project POSER-CLIMA are essential instruments of action to carry out this journey."	0.04	0.34	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.05	0.00	0.00	0.08

The electricity access rate reached 90%, meaning only about 10 out of 100 people are in a situation of energy exclusion, belonging to the disadvantaged social strata and population of remote areas of Cabo Verde. Ensuring access to electrical power for all people is the goal of the Government of Cabo Verde in 2021. The Government approved the legal regime of the social tariff for electricity as a measure to protect consumers of electricity in situations of economic vulnerability. Energy efficiency is a challenge to be overcome, and the sector's resilience and sustainability conditions are still lacking, in particular this challenge can be overcome by combating the high level of non-technical losses and improving the operational efficiency of energy pro- duction, transportation and distribution. Cabo Verde's strategy is to increase the sector's resilience to external shocks by reducing energy dependence on imported fossil fuels, with the large- scale exploitation of renewable energy potential in the country. The production of renewable energy has made significant progress with a penetration rate of 16.9% in 2017 and the use of the great potential of endogenous renewable resources, notably the wind and solar component, is acknowledged as being strategic for reducing the electricity and water cost, increasing energy security and competitiveness and national economy diversity."	0.11	0.01	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.43	0.00	0.01	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Lessons learned from the achievement of the MDGs underscore the importance of investing in a permanent mechanism to track progress, fulfilment, and escape specific demand at key moments of analysis and accountability. The establishment and reinforcement of post-2015 SDGs monitoring mechanisms and capacities should be addressed from the outset in a small country context to ensure the continued health of national planning and to combine competing priorities that put pressure on the Public Administration, proportioned to the size of the country, with the availability of limited resources and capabilities."	0.01	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.02	0.05	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.43
