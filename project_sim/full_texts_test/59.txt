The Bahamas recognises that to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the country will also need strong institutions and access to the necessary resources. Notwithstanding the high GDP per capita of the country, The Bahamas remains a vulnerable, developing country. The Government continues to take steps to strengthen its public institutions including, the introduction of a new programme to strengthen its financial and budgetary management systems, programme delivery capacity and the development of a National Statistical System. Strengthening the countryÕs statistical capacity to produce high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, is particularly critical to support    effective policy and decision-making and to ensure the continuous review of the countryÕs progress in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.	59
