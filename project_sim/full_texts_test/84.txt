Goal 7 of the NDP is focused on building a nation free of poverty and discrimination (including gender, nationality and disabilities). The various action items in this NDP goal address inequality (economic and social exclusion of poor and vulnerable groups limiting their access to basic goods and services); the high unemployment rate among vulnerable groups; intolerably high levels of youth unemployment and social exclusion; a high poverty rate in single parent households, discrimination against vulnerable groups (those with disabilities, migrants and women); and high levels of violence (gender-based violence, sexual assault, child abuse and child neglect). In addition to Goal 7, other goals associated with SDG1 include: Goal 8.2 and 8.3, dealing with the issue of land ownership and the manner in which Crown Land is administered. Goal 11.2 addresses how poverty is worsened in communities that are affected by disaster. Thus, an integrated disaster risk reduction policy is the way forward to manage these impacted communities. Finally, Goal 6 of the NDP is critical for SDG1 in improving the financial literacy that, in turn, will improve personal and household resilience and ownership within local economy.	84
