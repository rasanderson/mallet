The low elevation of The Bahamas, with over 80% of land mass within one metre of sea level, coupled with the reality that the majority of the countryÕs settlements and development occur near the coast, means that the country is extremely vulnerable to flooding particularly as a result of more intense tropical storms, rising sea levels and water tables due to climate change.
