With support from the UNDP, the Government commissioned the production of a Thematic Report ÒEnsuring Inclusive Development in the Bahamian SocietyÓ which identifies and outlines the status and challenges experienced by those identified as marginalised. The report concluded that The Bahamas with a GDP per capita rate similar to developed countries has structural barriers that place severe burdens on those that have been left behind. Issues of poverty, infrastructural challenges, gender inequality, climate change and unemployment have further exacerbated the challenges realised by marginalised groups. The thematic report focuses on marginalized groups and communities and people who are part of the weakest segments of the society. These groups include persons who face social exclusion due to discrimination, lack of power and those whose voices are often overlooked.	85
