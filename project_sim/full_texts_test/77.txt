Ecosystem-based adaptation is the Bahamas National Trust (BNT)Ã•s strategy for addressing the adaptation needs in The Bahamas. By ensuring that there are ecosystems protected, managed and healthy, we are able to ensure that they can adapt and provide beneficial functioning services into a changing climate. The BNT currently manages over 2.2 million acres of protected land and sea, and is working with the Government of The Bahamas (GOB) and other partners to establish more protected areas; research and monitor the areas using species identified as sensitive to climate change; develop climate-smart management plans; enforce the management strategies; restore areas as needed; and adapt the plan as circumstances change. The BNT has this integrated into its latest strategic plan. The BNT will also be developing policy for the GOB to consider to assist with reducing the human activities that exacerbate the impacts of climate change.	77
