The Bahamas, like other Small Island Developing States, is highly vulnerable to invasive alien species, largely due to its import-based economies. As an archipelago, The Bahamas has multiple and often porous borders, making it highly vulnerable to the introduction of invasive species. This can have many negative, potentially irreversible, environmental impacts and requires significant economic costs to control. These can also have negative multiplier effects on the many terrestrial species in the Bahamas, including endangered species such as the Bahama Parrot and West Indian Flamingo.Â¦	53
