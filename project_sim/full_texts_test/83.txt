There is need for more strategic use of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and stronger integration into the global economy through trade to enable stronger growth. The World Investment Report (UNCTAD, 2012), for example, identifies The Bahamas as being below expectations in FDI effectiveness despite having a high FDI to GDP stock. The country is a party to the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union and is in the process of becoming a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). While the accession process has been protracted, a renewed push has accelerated the process since 2017. Improving productivity is also critical to long-term economic growth and development. The Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC) in examining Total Factor Productivity identified the inefficient utilisation of resources as a major hurdle for The Bahamas.	83
