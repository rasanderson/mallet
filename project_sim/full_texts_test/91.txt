As the fallout from the 2007/8 financial crisis spread to The Bahamas, adversely impacting the key sectors of the economy, there was considerable pressure on the government to increase its spending to compensate for the reduction in domestic demand resulting from the economic downturn. This led to a steep growth in the fiscal deficit and a corresponding increase in the debt levels. The fiscal deficit peaked at 6.9% of GDP in FY2012/13, but fell to 4.8% of GDP in FY2014/15 in response to the improved revenue picture and even lower to a rate of 2.6 in 2016/2017. The national debt, which was below 40% in 2007, rose to 66.8% of GDP in 2017. This debt burden and associated costs reduced the government√ïs ability to tackle broader issues.	91
