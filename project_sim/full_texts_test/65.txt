The Bahamas recognises that in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the country will also need strong institutions and access to the necessary resources. The Government has and continues to take steps to strengthen its public institutions including through: the introduction of a new programme to strengthen its financial and budgetary management systems; programme delivery capacity; and the development of a National Statistical System. Strengthening the countryÕs statistical capacity to produce high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, is critical to support effective policy and decision-making and to ensure the continuous review of the countryÕs progress in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.	65
