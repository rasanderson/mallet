The Bahamas continues to participate and receive support at the international level to address issues surrounding climate change. The Bahamas established a National Climate Change Committee in 1996 as part of its obligations under the United Nations Framework for Climate Change (UNFCC). A public education and outreach subcommittee was established in 2010 to increase public education about climate change which includes local NGOs and environmental institutions. A project sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) focuses on integrated coastal zone management to support the country in adapting to climate change and reduce its vulnerability to coastal hazards.	89
