One of the world√ïs first land and sea parks, the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park was established in 1958 and is managed by the BNT. Today Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are managed by both the BNT at a total of 2.5 million acres, and by the Department of Marine Resources at 84,173 acres. The Department of Marine Resources has identified land-based impacts and coastal development as a significant threat to coastal and marine environment. This is seen through the direct impacts of dredging, removal of mangroves, landfilling, altering of beaches for human activities, construction of unregulated buildings on coastlines and indirect impacts from pesticides, sewage discharge and runoff. The removal of mangroves and dunes and destruction of coral reefs further increases the vulnerability of local populations to storm surges and rising sea levels and removes critical habitats for juvenile marine species.	50
