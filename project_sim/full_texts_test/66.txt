Groups and communities which are marginalized or have not benefited sufficiently from the successes of the country have been identified. Strengthening the resilience of these groups is a key goal of the recommendations and the implementation framework of the SDGs through the National Development Plan. It is important, for example, to develop programmes that address the underlying causes of poverty and joblessness in the country. These programmes must consider the special issues of the elderly, youth at risk and the particular, but different challenges for both men and women. This includes the need for applying a gendered lens to policy solutions and programme development. There are also geographical disparities within the country Ð with some of the most vulnerable communities being found on the more sparsely populated islands of The Bahamas and also on New Providence in one of the oldest and most historic communities. For this reason, the Government in collaboration with Civil Society, Academia and the Private Sector has created a special zone for a traditionally marginalized region known as the ÒOver the Hill CommunityÓ as a pilot for a comprehensive poverty alleviation strategy focusing on social and economic empowerment, rejuvenation, smart and green technology and programmes which focus on youth and the elderly.	66
