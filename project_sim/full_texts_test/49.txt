In the Bahamas, marine ecosystems include seagrass beds, coral reefs, blue holes and open oceans which all provide refuge and feeding grounds for fish and other marine life and support  s habitats and vast oceanic food webs. Corals and seagrass beds provide numerous ecosystem services such as shoreline protection, shelter, food, sand production, tourist attractions, and educational and scientific opportunities.
